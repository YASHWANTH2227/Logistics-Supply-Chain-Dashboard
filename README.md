**Project Title**
Logistics and Supply Chain Dashboard

**Short Description / Purpose**
This project is created to analyze and understand the reasons behind delivery delays and product returns within a logistics and supply chain framework. It focuses on identifying why these issues are occurring, which regions are most affected, and how to solve these problems using data-driven insights. The ultimate goal is to improve operational efficiency, reduce delays and returns, and enhance overall business performance.

**Tech Stack Used**

* Power BI: For building interactive visual dashboards and reports
* DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For custom calculations and performance metrics
* Data Modeling: For organizing relationships between different data tables
* Power Query (M Language): For transforming, cleaning, and shaping the data
* Calculated Columns and Measures: To generate insights such as delay percentages, return rates, and regional performance indicators

**Data Source**
The data used in this project is collected from various sources, primarily from Kaggle.com. It includes fields such as Order Date, Delivery Date, Return Status, Region, Product Category, and Delivery Type, among others.

**Features and Highlights**
